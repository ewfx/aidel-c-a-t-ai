Founded in 1975, the company became highly influential in the rise of personal computers through software like Windows, and the company has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing, video gaming and other fields. Microsoft is the largest software maker, one of the most valuable public U.S. companies, and one of the most valuable brands globally.\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000.  He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011, and an increased focus on hardware that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface, in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia.",

Free zones may be broadly categorized as seaport free zones, airport free zones, and mainland free zones. Free-trade zone exemptions are:\n\n100% foreign ownership of the enterprise\n100% import and export tax exemptions\n100% repatriation of capital and profits\nCorporate tax exemptions for up to 50 years\nNo personal income taxes\nAssistance with labor recruitment, and additional support services, such as sponsorship and housing.\nEach Free Zone is designed around one or more strict industry categories. An independent Free Zone Authority (FZA) governs each free zone, and is the agency responsible for issuing FTZ operating licenses and assisting companies with establishing their business in the FTZ. Each free zone has its own specific requirements regarding minimum capital requirements, office or warehouse space and permitted activities; with each possessing the relevant licenses and adequate legislation to enable their dedicated industry to flourish.\nInvestors can either register a new company in the form of a Free Zone Establishment (FZE) or simply establish a branch or representative office of their existing or parent company based within the UAE or abroad. An FZE is a limited liability company governed by the rules and regulations of the Free Zone in which it is established. Except for acquiring nationality in the UAE, the provisions of the Commercial Companies Law (CCL) do not apply to FZEs, provided that the Free Zones have special provisions regulating such companies.\nFree zone companies can run business within the relevant zone or outside the UAE. Some free zones (including ADGM, JAFZA, DMCC, RAK FTZ) allow for inward redomiciliation of foreign companies, which means a transfer of a corporate seat of an existing company from abroad to the UAE free zone.",

From 1929 to 1937, following its merger with Disconto-Gesellschaft, it was known as Deutsche Bank und Disconto-Gesellschaft or DeDi-Bank.:\u200a580\u200a Other transformative acquisitions have included those of Mendelssohn & Co. in 1938, Morgan Grenfell in 1990, Bankers Trust in 1998, and Deutsche Postbank in 2010.\nAs of 2018, the bank"s network spanned 58 countries with a large presence in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It is a component of the DAX stock market index and is often referred to as the largest German banking institution, with Deutsche Bank holding the majority stake in DWS Group for combined assets of 2.2 trillion euros, rivaling even Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe in terms of combined assets.\nDeutsche Bank has been designated a global systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board since 2011. It has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.\nAccording to a 2020 article in the New Yorker, Deutsche Bank had long had an "abject" reputation among major banks, as it has been involved in major scandals across various issue areas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1870–1933 ===\nDeutsche Bank was founded in 1870 in Berlin as a specialist bank for financing foreign trade and promoting German exports.',
        "receiver_wikipedia": "An international joint venture (IJV) occurs when two businesses based in two or more countries form a partnership. A company that wants to explore international trade without taking on the full responsibilities of cross-border business transactions has the option of forming a joint venture with a foreign partner. International investors entering into a joint venture minimize the risk that comes with an outright acquisition of a business. In international business development, performing due diligence on the foreign country and the partner limits the risks involved in such a business transaction.\nIJVs aid companies to form strategic alliances, which allow them to gain competitive advantage through access to a partner's resources, including markets, technologies, capital and people. International joint ventures are viewed as a practical vehicle for knowledge transfer, such as technology transfer, from multinational expertise to local companies, and such knowledge transfer can contribute to the performance improvement of local companies. Within IJVs one or more of the parties is located where the operations of the IJV take place and also involve a local and foreign company.\n\n\n== Basic elements ==\nThese include:\n\nContractual Agreement - IJVs are established by express contracts that consist of one or more agreements involving two or more individuals or organizations and that are entered into for a specific business purpose.\nSpecific Limited Purpose and Duration - IJVs are formed for a specific business objective and can have a limited life span or be long-term. IJVs are frequently established for a limited duration because (a) the complementary activities involve a limited amount of assets; (b) the complementary assets have only a limited service life; and/or (c) the complementary production activities will be of only limited efficacy.",

#           ### **Evaluation Criteria (Total: 500 points)**
#           Assign a risk score (0-100) to each factor, with **higher scores indicating higher risk**:
#           1. **Sender Entity Reputation Risk (0-100):** Based on Wikipedia data, fraud history, regulatory violations, or negative media coverage.
#           2. **Receiver Entity Reputation Risk (0-100):** Based on Wikipedia data, fraud history, regulatory violations, or negative media coverage.
#           3. **Sender Country Risk (0-100):** Based on FATF high-risk jurisdictions, OFAC/UN/UK/US sanctions, known terrorist financing activities, corruption index, or tax havens.
#           4. **Receiver Country Risk (0-100):** Based on FATF high-risk jurisdictions, OFAC/UN/UK/US sanctions, known terrorist financing activities, corruption index, or tax havens.
#           5. **Flagged Notes Risk (0-100):** Based on suspicious transaction descriptions (e.g., "urgent", "anonymous", "missing invoice", "offshore entity", "large cash movement", "shell company").

#           ### **Sanctioned Countries & Watchlists**
#           Consider high-risk jurisdictions in the **FATF Blacklist, FATF Grey List, OFAC Sanctions List, UN Sanctions List, and UK High-Risk List**:
#           {sanctioned_countries}

#           ### **Instructions:**
#           1. Assign a score (0-100) for each risk factor using the provided evaluation criteria.
#           2. The **overall risk score** is the sum of the individual risk factors (**maximum score: 500**).
#           3. Categorize the transaction risk level:
#             - **Low Risk (0-150)**
#             - **Medium Risk (151-300)**
#             - **High Risk (301-500)**
#           4. Provide a clear and **detailed justification** for the assigned scores.
#           5. **Ensure the output is always in valid JSON format** with no extra text or explanations.
